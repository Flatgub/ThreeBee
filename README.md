# ThreeBee
ThreeBee is a WIP 3D rendering framework for GameMaker Studio 2.3 which adds a variety of additional features for making working in 3D with GM much more reasonable. 
This includes a versatile RenderComponent system with support for things like per-object and per-camera shader overrides, importing of obj files, familiar unity-style gizmos such as light, 3D audio sources and cameras,  and a WIP skeletal animation system.
